 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! ðŸŽ‰

 About the Challenge

The **100 Days of Code** is a self-improvement challenge for coders. The goal is to code for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. This challenge encourages consistency, discipline, and the continuous improvement of programming skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository will be updated daily with my code, projects, and progress. Here's how it's organized:

- **Day 1 to Day 100:** Each day has its own folder containing the code and any related files or documentation for that day's challenge.
- **Projects:** Some days may involve working on larger projects. These projects will be organized into separate folders within their respective day's directory.

## How to Navigate the Repository

You can navigate through the repository by browsing the folders named `Day1`, `Day2`, ..., `Day100`. Each folder contains:
- **Code:** The primary code written on that day.
- **README.md:** A brief explanation of what was accomplished, learned, or any challenges faced on that day.
- **Resources:** Any additional resources, links, or references used.
